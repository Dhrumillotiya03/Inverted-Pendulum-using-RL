# Inverted-Pendulum-using-RL
 The projectâ€™s goal is to train a MATLAB-based reinforcement learning (RL)
 agent to stabilize a plant.The challenge is to bring a pendulum back to its
 upright position and make it stabilize there. The RL Agent used here is Policy Gradi
ent Agent(PG Agent).  
Environment.m contain the environment of inverted pendulum created for RL agent to act on it.   
untitled.mlx contains the code of Agent initialization and subsequent training of the agent on environment. To train the agent, exploration & exploitation technique is used.
